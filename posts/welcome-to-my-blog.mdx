# Welcome to My Blog!

This is my first blog post using **Next.js** and **MDX**. I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences here.

## What You Can Expect

- Technical insights and tutorials
- Personal projects and learnings
- Random thoughts and observations

## How This Blog Works

This blog is built with:

- **Next.js 15** with App Router
- **MDX** for writing content with React components
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **GitHub Pages** for hosting

## Adding New Posts

To add a new blog post, simply create a new `.mdx` file in the `posts/` directory with frontmatter like this:

```markdown
---
title: "Your Post Title"
date: "2025-01-28"
excerpt: "A brief description of your post"
---

Your content here...
```

That's it! The blog will automatically pick up new posts and display them on the homepage.
