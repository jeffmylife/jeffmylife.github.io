excerpt: But what is vibe coding?
---

The term "vibe coding" was coined by OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy in an [X post](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383) on February 2, 2025. This legendary post has spawned a movement where startups let non-programmers build software. The key thing in this post I think is very under-appreciated here is that Andrej says it's "where you fully give in to the vibes." In other words, if you're reading the code or thinking about implementations, diffs, or architecture **you aren't vibe coding**. At least, strictly.

Here's the original tweet that started it all:

However, I think the term has expanded beyond the original intention of the post. My observation is that the term "vibe coding" has taken a life of its own - now meaning something like "user prompt-driven development". I include the "spec-driven development" trend in this too. It's any case where you ask for something and the system "figures out" how to code it for you.
