<blockquote style="font-size=1">
<p>i get chills down my spine <br />when i see fear <br />a touch of serene <br />or an idea<br />so right, such true <br />the universe and me <br />become One, aligned <br />so shiver, such freeze <br />or maybe i left the window open<br />it&rsquo;s just a breeze</p>
